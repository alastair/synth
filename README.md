Introduction
------------
This is a synthsiser written in javascript / HTML5.
It provides 2 modes of synthesis (Additive and FM) and gives 4
oscillators/envelope combinations (called 'operators') for use in
synthesising sounds.
Any of the 4 operators can be used for additive synthesis.  FM synthesis
uses the first 2 operators as the modulator and carrier, respectively.

To create a new voice, hit the Add new voice button. Click Edit voice to
change the settings. You can give it a new name and choose the synthesis
mode.
Choose a frequency multiplier for each operator, or turn it off using
the button in the top corner. Use the View envelope link to change
the ADSR envelope associated with the operator.

To save your voices to the browser you are using, click the Save synth button.
The synth will automatically restore these voices when you visit the page
again, or you can use the Load synth button to load them manually.
The Reset button will throw away all of your changes and load the default
voices.
Use the Panic button to turn off a runaway synth.

There is a display of the signal waveform and the signal spectrum. Click
Show display to toggle this.

Use the keyboard at the bottom of the screen to play the synth. Middle C is
marked.
